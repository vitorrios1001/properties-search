## Properties Search üè†üîç

Welcome to Properties Search! This is a property search project that utilizes the Repliers.io API to search for properties based on provided locations (latitude and longitude). The location autocomplete is powered by the @mapbox/search-js-react library. The project is built with ReactJS, Next.js, and utilizes other technologies such as TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, react-responsive-carousel, and @iconify/react.
